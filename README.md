Iowa Housing Price Prediction üè°
This project uses machine learning to predict housing prices based on the Ames, Iowa housing dataset. The goal is to build a regression model that accurately estimates the final sale price of a house.

‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow
Data Loading: The Iowa_housing_prices.csv dataset is loaded using pandas.

Data Cleaning: Columns with missing values (NA) were initially dropped to create a baseline dataset.

Feature Selection:

An initial model was built using all available features after cleaning.

A second, more focused model was built using a subset of features: LotArea, LotConfig, LotShape, MSZoning, BldgType, Neighborhood, and GarageCars.

Preprocessing:

The data was split into training and testing sets.

Numeric features were scaled using StandardScaler.

Categorical features were encoded using OneHotEncoder.

Modeling: Two regression models were trained and evaluated:

Linear Regression

Random Forest Regressor

Evaluation: Models were evaluated based on Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R¬≤) metrics.

ü§ñ Models & Results
The project tested two different models. The Random Forest Regressor showed a better performance on the selected features compared to the Linear Regression model.

Initial Model (All Features)
Model: Linear Regression

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): $21,536.86

Second Model (Selected Features)
This iteration focused on a smaller set of features to see if performance could be improved.

Linear Regression
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): $32,965.99

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): $48,947.69

R-squared (R¬≤): 0.65

Random Forest Regressor
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): $31,199.09

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): $46,188.55

R-squared (R¬≤): 0.69

The key takeaway is the importance of feature selection and model choice. While the initial linear model with all features had a lower MAE, the Random Forest model provided a better R¬≤ value on a more curated feature set.
