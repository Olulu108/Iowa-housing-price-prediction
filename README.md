# Iowa Housing Price Prediction üè°

This project uses machine learning to predict housing prices based on the Ames, Iowa housing dataset. The goal is to build a regression model that accurately estimates the final sale price of a house.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading:** The Iowa_housing_prices.csv dataset is loaded using pandas.

2. **Data Cleaning:** Columns with missing values (NA) were initially dropped to create a baseline dataset.

3. **Feature Selection:**

    * An initial model was built using all available features after cleaning.

    * A second, more focused model was built using a subset of features: LotArea, LotConfig, LotShape, MSZoning, BldgType, Neighborhood, and GarageCars.

4. **Preprocessing:**

    * The data was split into training and testing sets.
  
    * Numeric features were scaled using StandardScaler.

    * Categorical features were encoded using OneHotEncoder.

5. **Modeling:** Two regression models were trained and evaluated:

    * Linear Regression

    * Random Forest Regressor

6. **Evaluation:** Models were evaluated based on Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R¬≤) metrics.

## ü§ñ Models & Results
The project tested two different models. The Random Forest Regressor showed a better performance on the selected features compared to the Linear Regression model.

**Initial Model (All Features)**

* **Model:** Linear Regression

* **Mean Absolute Error (MAE): $21,536.86**

**Second Model (Selected Features)**

This iteration focused on a smaller set of features to see if performance could be improved.

**Linear Regression**

* **Mean Absolute Error (MAE): $32,965.99**

* **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): $48,947.69**

* **R-squared (R¬≤): 0.65**

**Random Forest Regressor**

* **Mean Absolute Error (MAE): $31,199.09**

* **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): $46,188.55**

* **R-squared (R¬≤): 0.69**


The key takeaway is the importance of feature selection and model choice. While the initial linear model with all features had a lower MAE, the Random Forest model provided a better R¬≤ value on a more curated feature set.
