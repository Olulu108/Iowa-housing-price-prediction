# Iowa Housing Price Prediction üè°

### A Machine Learning Project to Forecast Housing Prices in Iowa

This project provides a complete walkthrough of a machine learning workflow to predict housing prices using the Ames, Iowa dataset. The analysis covers everything from data cleaning and feature engineering to training and comparing regression models. The goal is to build a model that accurately estimates the final sale price of a house.

## üìä Project Analysis & Key Insights

The core of this project is a systematic approach to building and evaluating a predictive model. The process demonstrates key techniques in data preprocessing and machine learning to uncover factors influencing house prices.

### Key Findings from the Analysis

The analysis provides several key insights into the Ames housing market and the effectiveness of different modeling techniques:

* **Feature Importance:** The analysis revealed that features like `GarageCars`, `Neighborhood`, and `LotArea` are strong predictors of the final sale price.

* **Model Performance:** The Random Forest Regressor (`R¬≤: 0.69`) significantly outperformed the baseline Linear Regression model (`R¬≤: 0.65`), showing its strength in handling complex, non-linear relationships.

* **Data Preprocessing Impact:** Effective scaling of numeric data with `StandardScaler` and one-hot encoding of categorical data were crucial steps for achieving model accuracy.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading:** The Iowa_housing_prices.csv dataset is loaded using pandas.

2. **Data Cleaning:** Columns with missing values (NA) were initially dropped to create a baseline dataset.

3. **Feature Selection:**

    * An initial model was built using all available features after cleaning.

    * A second, more focused model was built using a subset of features: LotArea, LotConfig, LotShape, MSZoning, BldgType, Neighborhood, and GarageCars.

4. **Preprocessing:**

    * The data was split into training and testing sets.
  
    * Numeric features were scaled using StandardScaler.

    * Categorical features were encoded using OneHotEncoder.

5. **Modeling:** Two regression models were trained and evaluated:

    * Linear Regression

    * Random Forest Regressor

6. **Evaluation:** Models were evaluated based on Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R¬≤) metrics.

## ü§ñ Models & Results
The project tested two different models. The Random Forest Regressor showed a better performance on the selected features compared to the Linear Regression model.

### **Initial Model (All Features)**

* **Model**: Linear Regression
* **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: `$21,536.86`

### **Final Model Comparison (Selected Features)**

#### Linear Regression

* **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: `$32,965.99`
* **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: `$48,947.69`
* **R-squared (R¬≤)**: `0.65`

#### **Random Forest Regressor (Best Performing Model)**

* **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: **`$31,199.09`**
* **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: **`$46,188.55`**
* **R-squared (R¬≤)**: **`0.69`**

The key takeaway is the importance of feature selection and model choice. While the initial linear model with all features had a lower MAE, the Random Forest model provided a better R¬≤ value on a more curated feature set.
